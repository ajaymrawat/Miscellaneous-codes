# Miscellaneous-codes
This repository contains several basic codes used in the reactive scattering community. However, these codes may also find their use elsewhere.<br>
Each code is kept inside a folder arranged in numeric order. </br>
Check <mark> documentation.pdf </mark> for detail description of codes.
The following codes are available in the database.


## 01_reaction_probability
&emsp;&emsp;  Contain code to calculate total reaction probability for atom + diatom collisions for the diatomic rovibrational state of _j_=0/1.

## 02_cross-section
  <ul>
   <li><b> &emsp;&emsp;  Code:</b> ics-jneq.f90 </li><br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This calculates the ICS for (<i>v</i>, <i>j</i> &ne; 0) diatomic state in a atom-diatom reaction.
    <li><b> &emsp;&emsp; code:</b> version-02/stsics.f90 </li> <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This calculates the ICS for (<i>v</i>, <i>j</i> = 0) diatomic state in a atom-diatom reaction. Rotational and vibration level resolved ICSs can be calculated from the code.
  </ul>
