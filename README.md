# Miscellaneous-codes
This repository contains several basic codes used in the reactive scattering community. However, these codes may also find their use elsewhere.<br>
Each code is kept inside a folder arranged in numeric order. The following codes are available in the database.


## 01_reaction_probability
  Contain code to calculate total reaction probability for atom+diatom collisions for the diatomic rovibrational state of _j_=0/1.
